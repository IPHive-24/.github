# Proposal
The proposal should be in **Document format** ( .docx , .md , .pptx ) , and the number of pages should not exceed **10 pages**. The content should be brief , but at the same time , should also cover all the **vital points**.

#### Proposals should be submitted Through ðŸ“§ barath.iphive24@gmail.com

Every proposal must follow the structure as mentioned below :

- Title
- Origin of the Idea
- POC (Proof of Concept)
- Detailed Description
- Innovation(if any)
- Expected outcomes in form of media(optional)
- Assurance of Completion
- Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for Project Completion

### Code of Conduct
Every project must follow the [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/ip-hive-24/.github/blob/main/CODEOFCONDUCT.md) along with the above format mentioned. The project must not be an **already existing project in the Organization**. People who are interested in adding more features to existing projects can **contribute** to the same.

### Documentation Requirements

All projects **MUST INCLUDE a README.md** file providing clear and concise instructions on how to use the project. Additionally, comprehensive documentation covering all objects, classes, and data members must be provided. Projects lacking a readable README.md or adequate documentation will be rejected, regardless of the project's significance.

As an Open-Source Organization, we exclusively accept public projects. Personal projects such as **portfolios** will not be considered for acceptance.

### Criteria for Acceptance

The likelihood of a proposal being accepted is influenced by the number of commits. Proposals with fewer commits but larger differences will have a higher chance of acceptance compared to those with more commits but smaller differences. Committing very small changes, except for issues, and excessive commit spamming are discouraged as they may indicate improper maintenance of the source code.

# Pull Requests

Contributions to existing repositories involve forking the repositories, making changes, and creating a Pull Request (PR). The acceptance of pull requests is solely controlled by the respective repository owners and not the Organization.

Guides on creating a Pull Request:
- [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/)

A Pull Request must include:
- Title: A concise yet descriptive title.
- Description: A detailed explanation.
- Media: Screenshots or demo videos.

# Issues

Issues are raised to report errors in the source code. They can be acknowledged in the Issues panel of the repository. Once reviewed by a developer, they may be resolved or assigned to others. You can also request assignment of an issue to yourself by mentioning it.

Documentation on Issues:
- [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/github-search-tips/)

Issues must be structured and clear, including:
- Error Description: Describing the error with the source code snippet and suggesting a solution, if any.
- How to Reproduce: Detailing how to reproduce the code to generate the error for further development.
- Anything Else: Additional contents or suggestions.
